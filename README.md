# The-automatic-recognition-of-splice-junction-in-DNA

A fully connected multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) model is proposed
for the automatic recognition of key genetic junctions between introns and exons in DNA. The
ANN was built by minimizing the error between predictions and DNA sequences labels. The optimal ANN structure is (60,10,10,1). The 10-fold cross-validation
accuracy is of 95.6 % which is better than that of Towell et al.
